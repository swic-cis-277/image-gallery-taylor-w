Use of this starter template assumes that you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, VS Code, at least. If not, you may want to [start here.](https://www.notion.so/codefinity/Setting-up-a-Local-Dev-Environment-for-JS-02a4e9f4a30043d3a8e7d109be3448f4)

After `clon`ing with 'HTTPS', `cd` into the repo directory.

As always...as always, kindly do, `npm i` **(`npm install` on 'GitBash')** to get the necessary modules installed from the list of `devDependencies` and `depnedencies` in 'package.json.' **Be sure that you have `cd`ed into the 'repo directory' first!** Otherwise, the command will not work as there is no 'package.json.'

This project is well-suited for newer JS students. It includes linting and several useful VS Code settings and extensions to assist with 'coding tasks.'

For this to work, you should look in the bottom right of your VS Code upon opening this project (from the terinal, you should have entered `code .`) and, if prompted, install/accept any VS Code extensions/settings. **Without this, you would be on your own to take care of formatting and linting the code on your own** (unless you already know what you are doing...then maybe you don't even need to be in this repo).

One of these extensions uses [Kite](https://www.kite.com/javascript/). Students should _strongly_ consider creating an account there and allowing this integration into VS Code.
