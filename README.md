# Vanilla HTML-CSS-JS Gallery

This assignment debuts vanilla **Javascript** to manipulate images on a page. 
It is a single-page assignment, and uses the `main` div as a place to showcase the image the user selects, or "left-clicks".

**CSS** styling inludes basic coloring, centering and bordering effects - along with basic spacing and padding for visual effect.

**CSS** class styles are used to apply a *circle* affect `onClick()` thanks to the works of vanilla **Javascript**.

Simply put, we select the `main` and apply a CSS class when the user clicks a `div` which is made to look as a button.
##### There is no real reason to why I used a div over an actual button, it's just what I started to work with first.
